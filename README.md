# Logistic Regression Model using SMOTE

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Logistic Regression model using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in binary classification problems.

## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a powerful technique for binary classification. However, when faced with imbalanced datasets, where one class is underrepresented, the model's performance might suffer. SMOTE is a method designed to tackle this issue by generating synthetic instances of the minority class.

This repository showcases a step-by-step guide to build a Logistic Regression model while integrating SMOTE for improved performance on imbalanced data.
